# Data Science Deliberate Practice

This document is a blatant ripoff of Robert Chang's [Python Deliberate Practice](https://github.com/robert8138/python-deliberate-practice), which I found through his medium post [Advice for New and Junior Data Scientists](https://medium.com/@rchang/advice-for-new-and-junior-data-scientists-2ab02396cf5b). I also noticed that he started up a new [Deep Learning Deliberate Practice](https://github.com/robert8138/deep-learning-deliberate-practice) and from a cursory glance there are a lot of excellent resources compiled there. This is my attempt to compile a similar set of resources to bolster my weak points in data science and to hold myself accountable and disciplined to deliberately and consistently practice these things.

Robert's first lines and links from his python deliberate practice page were inspirational enough to keep so I can come back to them when I need them.

> First of all, don't be afraid, read [Plateau of Productivity]. More importantly, be patient, a good read from Peter Norvig, titled [Teach Yourself Programming in 10 years].

## Motivation

I've been thinking about doing data science for a while now. While I was in graduate school data science burst on the scene as the hot, new field to be in and another *alternative career* for science PhDs. At the same time I was learning python for the second time and digging deep into data analysis for my thesis project. After getting over the growing pains on my path towards the plateau of productivity I really started to enjoy making tools even though they were pretty terrible at the time.

I didn't end up going into data science once I finished my PhD in molecular biophysics though. I treated data science as a backup plan along with biotech industry jobs. My first choice has been the *mainstream* academic track, which meant doing a postdoc. There were lots of things wrapped up in that decision, probably too much to go into here. But I did want to hedge my bets a bit so that I would end up in a lab environment where part of my job would at least involve coding with some sort of standardized practice.

I've had a great time in my postdoc and work with an awesome group of people. But I haven't spent much time learning about cool data science things. To remedy this situation I've copied this document from [Robert Chang](https://github.com/robert8138/python-deliberate-practice) to hold myself accountable and get myself regularly learning new things.

## Deliberate Practice

I am a huge believer in learning by doing, and there are a lot of opportunities on the job where I can hone my Python skills through Deliberate Practice:

* **Identify the Top Performers**: I think there are quite a few people at Work (e.g. Dan F.) who can really be a role model for me to follow. Understand what they've been through to get to where they are today. What is their mental representation that I do not have about Python.

* **Build Practice Plans**: Ideally, based on the rough understanding of that mental representation:

    * Define clear goals and select learning materials
    * Create deadline and milestones for the project
    * Estimate time required and come up weekly schedules

  Augment these insights with your current level of mental representation of Python to improve your understanding.

* **Targeted Practice**: If I force myself to switch over to Python for Data Analysis, Data visualization, Modeling, or contribute to our internal Python Data Analysis packages, I can maximize my time practicing this skill, which is high leverage.

* **Immediate Feedbacks**: We have a culture of code reviews, both for IC work as well as internal package work. The former is harder because most DS on our team are in the R camp. There's also the weekly Python office hours that should be very useful. Find constant opportunities to get feedback as much as you can.

## Performance Goals

* **[Immediate]** Do data sciencey things regularly.
* **[Shorter term, easiest to practice]** Work through tutorials of different python packages commonly used in data science.
* **[Medium term, harder to practice]** Refresh once-known topics in linear algebra and statistics.
* **[Longer term, hardest to practice]** Expand linear algebra and statistics knowledge to understand machine learning techniques and implement them effectively.

## Project Goals

* **Outcome**: Build my own data products.

* **Curriculum**: Basic linear algebra and mid-level statistics. Go through sci-kit learn's and natural language processing tutorials.

* **Timeframe**: Be done with linear algebra by the end of June. Done with machine learning by end of July. First major data product by mid-August.
