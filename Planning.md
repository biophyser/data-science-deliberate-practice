## What Data Science Principles Do You Want To Learn?

* Linear algebra refresher
* Statistics using python
* Basic machine learning
* Natural language processing
* Software engineering basics (if there's time)

## Estimate Time Required To Achieve Goal

I will give myself the summer of 2018 to work on this goal.

**Timeframe**: Finish stats work by end of June. Get through basic machine learning by the end of July. Create a data product/example by mid-August.
